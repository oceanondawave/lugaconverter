# lugaconverter
A simple web app to normalize DOCX documents (from Unicode NFD to Unicode NFC) for visually impaired individuals.

# Note and Usage Instructions:
- Free, free, free — and always will be. This is a community-supported tool. If you come across any other tool that copies this one and charges a fee, it's not the official version. Please report it to me immediately.
- Only .docx files are supported. You cannot upload files with other extensions. If your .doc file doesn't upload, please save it as a .docx file (for example, using 'Save As' in Microsoft Word) and try uploading again.
- Your file data is encrypted (using encrypted AES and public/private keys method).
- Please upload a .docx file. Once selected successfully, you’ll hear a confirmation sound. Then click the button to upload and process. After processing, the new file will be automatically downloaded, and you’ll hear another confirmation sound. It’s very fast and fully automated! The new file will include '[lugaconverter]' at the end of its name.
- The website may be slow if there are many users accessing it at the same time. Since I'm using a free service, this might happen occasionally — please be patient and try again later!
